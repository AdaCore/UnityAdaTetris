Using Ada technologies to develop video games doesn’t sound like an an obvious choice - although it seems like there could be an argument to be made. The reverse, however, opens some more straightforward perspectives. There’s no reason why a code base developed in Ada couldn’t benefit from a game engine to support the user interface. Think of a flight simulator for example, running a mission computer in Ada.

In the past few years, a number of these have been made available to a larger audience, mostly to serve the so-called indie scene. In this blog post, we’ll concentrate on Unity, which has the advantage of using the Mono environment as scripting language. As there is no flight mission computer at AdaCore, we’ll use a slightly modified version, the SPARK/Ada example already ported to a number of environments. So that’ll be a game in Ada after all!
